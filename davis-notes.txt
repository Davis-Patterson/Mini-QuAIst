Davis Notes: 📝



Completed: ✅


styled main page ✅
added routing ✅
created login and register components (still need back end) ✅
moved game to it's own component ✅
created temp battle coponent ✅
refactored footer and it's position ✅
gave 'game-container' set height/width to be main game window ✅
switch map being static and character moving freely to character being static and map moving freely. This will keep the character in the center at all times. ✅
created temporary routes for game components 'battle', 'dialogue', and 'create' ✅
Refactored map again this time to accomodate .png maps generated with Tiled ✅
Added collisions overlay on top of map ✅
fix character icon from sliding in place ✅
hold shift to speed up character ✅
remove diagonal ability (interfere's with character direcion) ✅
  -if you're holding x direction down and then you hit y direction, it won't realign to looking x direction after you let go of y direction button 
collision detection version 1.0 !! ✅
  -added collision overlay, still a little touchy especially when running 
took map etc out of game and made 'overworld' component. Game should just be responsible for game flow logic ✅
took char_animate out of char_move and separated those responsibilites ✅
added basic npcs onto the map (chest, old man) ✅
added interactionsData.js and incorporated it into collision logic ✅
add <NPC /> component to overlay npcs onto the map. ✅
Wiki ? ✅
conditional rendering on 'login' (nav & footer) and 'home' (footer) buttons when pathname === '/login' or '/home' not working currently ✅
<NPC /> component not mapping correctly. ✅
offset character by half tileSize to get it centered ✅
update the map with the gate data ✅
add 2 small maps and test character switching between maps through map gates ✅
  -spawn points & character direction corrospond to gate ✅
got rid of char_animate and put it all into <Char /> ✅
created <NPC /> component for each npc on a map, lives inside <NPC_Map />
combine 'collisions' 'interactions' and 'gates' into one 'collisions' list ✅
make NPC a component inside of NPC_Map so we can control animations etc ✅
add dialogue box above NPC head and test triggering dialogue ✅
make npc that the character is next to also highlighted (no border so doesn't work on NPCs that fill their entire tile such as the chest) ✅
figure out how to trigger an inteaction ✅
NPCs continue to animate between map changes ✅




To-Do Now: 🚨


conditionally render NPCs based on their 'alive' value

dialogue box is a little glitchy, flickers on and off when user in proximity

should only have box show up if 'isFPressed' and if user is in proximity. Walking away from NPC should cause message to disappear 
  -could maybe have a state for 'adjacentNpc' ?

make only the gate the character is next to highlighted (currently they all get highlighted)
  -make 'color' variable in 'gates' state, update specific gate color when in proximity instead of all gates

collision detection version 2.0 
  -add player-zone ✅ figure out running bug

buttons for main menu and inventory in top right of game screen






To-Do Later: 🤷‍♂️

music for different maps/components, footstep audio 
  - could maybe trigger footsetp audio in the character animation useEffect, then when the iteration speeds up the sound effect will speed up too 


intro cutscene with stable diffusion images
background music ?
  -mute icon in nav
set up back end


walking animation sometimes freezes on a walking frame, should implement a 'default' state for when not walking

add tool tips for early game 'to move, do this' 






Considerations 🧠

alternate collision data for when NPC is not 'alive' 

similar to how we animate the character, we could have 4 different maps with static animations that get switched between 

maybe add stamina meter for sprint etc ?

add 'Luck' skill to players that determines the roll needed on item rareness when opening a chest 


ability check should render on top of other components, after dice roll should automatically return user to game. 

have character stats show up during ability check 

sleeping at inn saves the game?
