Davis Notes:


Completed: 

styled main page ✅
added routing ✅
created login and register components (still need back end) ✅
moved game to it's own component ✅
created temp battle coponent ✅
refactored footer and it's position ✅
gave 'game-container' set height/width to be main game window ✅
switch map being static and character moving freely to character being static and map moving freely. This will keep the character in the center at all times. ✅
created temporary routes for game components 'battle', 'dialogue', and 'create' ✅
Refactored map again this time to accomodate .png maps generated with Tiled ✅
Added collisions overlay on top of map ✅



To-Do Now: 🚨

collision detection !!IMPORTANT 
  -added collision overlay, just need to get logic working 

fix character icon from sliding in place 

remove diagonal ability (interfere's with character direcion)
  -if you're holding x direction down and then you hit y direction, it won't realign to looking x direction after you let go of y direction button 
  

To-Do Later: 🤷‍♂️
intro cutscene with stable diffusion images
background music ?
  -mute icon in nav
set up back end
Wiki ?



Considerations 🧠

disable diagonal movement 
  -disable 'if last pressed' maybe or something
