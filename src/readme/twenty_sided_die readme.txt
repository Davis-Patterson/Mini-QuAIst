TwentySidedDie Component
-The TwentySidedDie component is a React component designed for handling twenty-sided dice rolls, typically used in tabletop role-playing games (RPGs) for ability checks.

Usage
Props
-typeOfCheck (string, required): Represents the type of ability check being made. This prop is used to retrieve the corresponding modifier from the charStats context.

-onRollComplete (function, optional): A callback function that will be called when the rolling process is complete. It receives the outcome of the roll ('passed' or 'failed') as an argument.

Styling
-The component has some basic styling applied to create a visually appealing representation of a twenty-sided die. You can customize the styles by modifying the inline styles within the component.

Component Logic
-The component uses the useState hook to manage the state of the dice roll and whether it has been rolled.

-The useEffect hook is employed to calculate the outcome of the roll based on the dice value, character modifiers, and a predefined difficulty score.

-The rollDie function generates a random number between 1 and 20 when the die is clicked, updating the state with the result.

-The handleContinue function is called when the "Continue" button is clicked, invoking the onRollComplete callback and updating the state.

Styling
-The component utilizes a combination of inline styles and CSS classes to create a visually appealing and interactive dice-rolling experience. You can modify the styles as needed to match your application's design.
