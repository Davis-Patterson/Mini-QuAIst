created temp battle coponent ✅
refactored footer and it's position ✅
gave 'game-container' set height/width to be main game window ✅

Added collisions overlay on top of map ✅
fix character icon from sliding in place ✅

  -if you're holding x direction down and then you hit y direction, it won't realign to looking x direction after you let go of y direction button 
collision detection version 1.0 !! ✅
  -added collision overlay, still a little touchy especially when running 
took map etc out of game and made 'overworld' component. Game should just be responsible for game flow logic ✅
took char_animate out of char_move and separated those responsibilites ✅
added basic npcs onto the map (chest, old man) ✅

combine 'collisions' 'interactions' and 'gates' into one 'collisions' list ✅
make NPC a component inside of NPC_Map so we can control animations etc ✅
add dialogue box above NPC head and test triggering dialogue ✅
make npc that the character is next to also highlighted (no border so doesn't work on NPCs that fill their entire tile such as the chest) ✅

To-Do Now: 🚨

modifier values in dialoge ability check should be colored based on their value

map audio doesn't mute when mute is hit, waits till song is done playing


conditionally render NPCs based on their 'alive' value

dialogue box is a little glitchy, flickers on and off when user in proximity

should only have box show up if 'isFPressed' and if user is in proximity. Walking away from NPC should cause message to disappear 
  -could maybe have a state for 'adjacentNpc' ?

make only the gate the character is next to highlighted (currently they all get highlighted)
  -make 'color' variable in 'gates' state, update specific gate color when in proximity instead of all gates

collision detection version 2.0 
  -add player-zone ✅ figure out running bug







To-Do Later: 🤷‍♂️

dialogue response loading indicator

include charStats in the dialogue prompts 


intro cutscene with stable diffusion images
background music ?
  -mute icon in nav
set up back end


walking animation sometimes freezes on a walking frame, should implement a 'default' state for when not walking

add tool tips for early game 'to move, do this' 






Considerations 🧠

dialogue component takes a very long time sometimes to populate results
  -long pause after 'well I better get going', etc.
NPCs often repeat their first dialogue 

alternate collision data for when NPC is not 'alive' 

maybe add stamina meter for sprint etc ?

add 'Luck' skill to players that determines the roll needed on item rareness when opening a chest 


ability check should render on top of other components, after dice roll should automatically return user to game. 

have character stats show up during ability check 

sleeping at inn saves the game?

'FAQ' man in the villaige could bring up the wiki or somehow route to the
